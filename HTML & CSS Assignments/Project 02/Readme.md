## Approach that i followed was - 
1. First i target the nav section where i align all the elements using `display:flex` and then i set the `height` and the `padding` of navbar and then after it i style logo, list and button.
2. Now I target the container below the navbar where i used again `position` property and some `margin`,  `padding`, `height` properties to set the heading, paragraph and button.
