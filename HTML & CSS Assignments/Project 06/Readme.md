## Approach that i followed was - 
1. The HTML structure was designed according to requirement. Here, `semantic` element are used for better understanding and whole webpage divided into two parts in which one is "nav-section" and other is "Hero-section" and then "Hero-section" is internally divided into two parts in which one is "upper-section" and another one is "lower-section". 
2. In the nav section where all elements are align using `display:flex` and then `height` and the `padding` used to set the navbar.
3. The hero section is divided into subpart which we can call them upper-section in which heading, paragraph is present and the lower-section in which image is present. In the container `display` property is used to align them and many other properties such as `width`, `margin`, `padding` etc. to set all the elements.
