## Approach that followed was - 
1. The HTML structure was designed according to requirement. Here, `semantic` element are used for better understanding and whole webpage divided into two parts in which one is "nav-section" and other is "Hero-section" and then "Hero-section" is internally divided into two parts in which one is "left-section" and another one is "right-section". 
2. In the nav section where all elements are align using `display:flex` and then `height` and the `padding` used to set the navbar.
3. The hero section is divided into subpart which we can call them left section in which heading, paragraph and button is present and the right section in which all the photo are present. In the container `display` property is used to align them and many other properties such as `width`, `margin`, `padding` etc. to set all the elements.
4. In this project new challenging things were to set the "top-angle" and "bottom-angle" image. so those were setted by using `pseudo-elements` and in the right section there are three images and those were setted by using `position` properties.
